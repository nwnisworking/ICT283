# ICT283 Data Structures and Abstractions 
Below is week 4 content of ICT283.

1. Create unit test for each classes. Each classes must ensure that set, get, and other methods work.
2. Move the body of methods from .h to .cpp.
3. Modify all C-style string to C++ string.
4. Restructure the rinput.txt by changing all (_) used in unit name to ( ). 
5. Create a Date class that contains day of the month, month, and the year and provide appropriate set and get methods.This also means the date needs to be added in each of the unit.
6. Convert all friend operators (<<) and (>>) to non-friend and move them out of the class.

## Note
Reading each column using >> creates an issue since it stops at the spacing. To mitigate this, `getline` is used to read the data since a delimiter can be placed to stop the code from execution, ensuring spaces can be read.
